Website
------
The website was originally coded by me using HTML, CSS, and very basic jQuery. Then I decided to switch to using a templating engine (Jekyll) to make editing easier. The original site is stored in 'public'. The new Jekyll-powered site is stored in 'nypd'. Now, I'm revamping the website to be built off of Twitter Bootstrap and Jekyll for responsiveness and a better aesthetic.
