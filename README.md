Given the team's renaming to Pandemic and subsequent website revamp, this repo and website are now obsolete. If interested in the latest version, please see [pandemic-web](https://github.com/phanieste/pandemic-web).

NYPD
======
NYPD stands for Neon Yellow Panda Dragons. We are Columbia University's Women's Ultimate Frisbee team. We are a club sport that plays at local, regional, and national level tournaments.


Website
------
The website was originally coded by me using HTML, CSS, and very basic jQuery. Then I decided to switch to using a templating engine (Jekyll) to make editing easier. The original site is stored in 'public'. The new Jekyll-powered site is stored in 'nypd'. Now, I'm revamping the website to be built off of Twitter Bootstrap and Jekyll for responsiveness and a better aesthetic.
